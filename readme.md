##INTRODUCTION##
This is a solution for wlan positioning. It is proposed on the basis of machine learning algorithm and therefore composed of two seperate phases: offline and online. This solution is based on client-server mode.

Offline phase would process raw data, split the whole dataset into training set(70%) and testing set(30%), and eventually yeild a training model according to records from training set, using certain algorithm.

Online phase would launch a positioning server after some initialization, the server would wait for request and call predict algorithm to return a result.

Apart from offline and online phase, we supply an extra testing phase for users to examine both efficiency and accuracy of certain algorithm.

##HOW TO USE##
+ offline phase: 
    ```
    ./offline.sh <device_dataset> <algorithm>. 
    ```
    >example: ./offline.sh htc NN

+ online phase: 
    ```
    ./online
    ```

+ testing phase: 

    ```
    ./test.py <device_dataset>
    `` `
    >example: ./test.py htc
    ```
    ./gen_test.py <device_dataset> 
    ```
    >will randomly generate testing dataset from specified device_dataset
